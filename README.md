## Introduction
This is a simple image recognition modeul using keras and mnist dataset.  
Using img_saver.py, you can generate the images by naming the png file as its predicted label.

So, this module is used in my Node with Express application.  
That application can allow you type some random integer and display the corresponding image on HTML. 

## Python Version
3.6

## Libraries
Mainly relying on keras, numpy, matplotlib

## Weights and Architectures
All saved in model.h5(Sequential Architecture) and model.json(weights)
